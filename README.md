# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This web application allows the user to search for a city and find the current weather and 5-day forecast. Once a city is entered in the input field and the search button is clicked, cards will be displayed with the current/forecast weather data. A past search button with the city name will also be generated with each search, allowing the user to quickly pull weather for any previously searched cities. This was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with Bootstrap for styling and Day.js convert date data. The weather data was fetched from the OpenWeather API via JavaScript.
